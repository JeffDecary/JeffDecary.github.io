"How can't you be romantic about baseball?" â€” *Moneyball* (2011)
Anything you care deeply aboutâ€”even the silliest thingsâ€”can be special!

## About Me
If we haven't met yet, my name is **Jeff Decary**. In Fall 2020, I began my Ph.D. journey at the **University of Connecticut (UConn)** in the Operations and Information Management department of the School of Business. Iâ€™m fortunate to be advised by **Professor David Bergman**.

Before joining UConn, I completed an M.Sc. in Mathematics at Polytechnique Montreal, where I worked at the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Data Science for Real-Time Decision-Making under the guidance of **Professor Andrea Lodi**. My studies began with a B.Sc. in Actuarial Science from the University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM).

## ðŸ”¹ Research Interests
My research lies at the intersection of mathematical optimizationâ€”particularly discrete optimizationâ€”game theory, and machine learning. I am broadly interested in designing algorithms for stochastic games, leveraging large datasets to analyze game dynamics and competitive strategies. My work spans from individual players to market-makers, focusing on strategy design in sports betting and predictive markets to tackle revenue maximization problems.

## ðŸ”¹ Outside of Research
I had the privilege of growing up in the vibrant city of Montreal, Canada. Much like my research, my hobbies are deeply intertwined with sports and games. As a true Canadian, I have a love for hockey, but in recent years, Iâ€™ve also taken up sailing and golf. However, my true passion lies in racket sportsâ€”these days, I primarily compete in tennis, pickleball, and badminton.

When Iâ€™m not playing or watching sports, youâ€™ll likely find me cooking, baking, traveling, or playing board gamesâ€”as long as friends or family are involved.

In a previous chapter of my life, I was among the top table tennis players in Canada. Recently, I had the opportunity to revive this skill in a unique wayâ€”by performing in a contemporary art show titled [Speed Glue](https://www.doriannuskindoder.com/choreography/speed-glue-2019/). The goal was to move beyond the competitive nature of sports and highlight their collaborative essence. This performance was a creative collaboration with my friend, Antoine Bernadet, and was beautifully choreographed by [Dorian Nuskind-Oder](https://www.doriannuskindoder.com/) and Simon Grenier-Poirier.

## ðŸ”¹ Final Thoughts
Thanks for taking the time to get to know me. As Robin Williams once said:
