"How can't you be romantic about baseball" â€” *Moneyball* (2011)
Anything you care deeply aboutâ€”even the silliest thingsâ€”can be special!

## About Me
If we haven't met yet, my name is **Jeff Decary**. In Fall 2020, I began my Ph.D. journey at the **University of Connecticut (UConn)** in the Operations and Information Management department of the School of Business. Iâ€™m fortunate to be advised by **Professor David Bergman**.

Before joining UConn, I completed an M.Sc. in Mathematics at Polytechnique Montreal, where I worked at the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Data Science for Real-Time Decision-Making under the guidance of **Professor Andrea Lodi**. My studies began with a B.Sc. in Actuarial Science from the University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM).

## ðŸ”¹ Research Interests
My research lies at the intersection of mathematical optimizationâ€”particularly discrete optimizationâ€”game theory, and machine learning. I am broadly interested in designing algorithms for stochastic games, leveraging large datasets to analyze game dynamics and competitive strategies. My work spans from individual players to market-makers, focusing on strategy design in sports betting and predictive markets to tackle revenue maximization problems.

## ðŸ”¹ Outside of Research
I had the privilege of growing up in the vibrant city of Montreal, Canada. Much like my research, my hobbies are deeply intertwined with sports and games. As a true Canadian, I have a love for hockey, but in recent years, Iâ€™ve also taken up sailing and golf. However, my true passion lies in racket sportsâ€”these days, I primarily compete in tennis, pickleball, and badminton.

When Iâ€™m not playing or watching sports, youâ€™ll likely find me cooking, baking, traveling, or playing board gamesâ€”as long as friends or family are involved.

In a previous chapter of my life, I was among the top table tennis players in Canada. Recently, I had the opportunity to revive this skill in a unique wayâ€”by performing in a contemporary art show titled [Speed Glue](https://www.doriannuskindoder.com/choreography/speed-glue-2019/). The goal was to move beyond the competitive nature of sports and highlight their collaborative essence. This performance was a creative collaboration with my friend, Antoine Bernadet, and was beautifully choreographed by [Dorian Nuskind-Oder](https://www.doriannuskindoder.com/) and Simon Grenier-Poirier.

## ðŸ”¹ Final Thoughts
Thanks for taking the time to get to know me. As Robin Williams once said:

======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
