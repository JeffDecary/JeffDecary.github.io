This study addresses the challenge of optimal portfolio allocation in a classical betting setting, assuming the bettor seeks to maximize log-utility. While the Kelly Criterion is well-established as the optimal allocation for a single bet, questions remain open regarding how to proceed when considering multiple bets, simultaneously. Building on prior literature, we present theoretical results on optimal parlay construction and propose a scalable logic-based Benders decomposition algorithm. We evaluate the algorithmâ€™s performance on both synthetic data and real-world sports betting instances, demonstrating its potential to enhance parlay strategies.
